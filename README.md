## Deployment information

1. Preparation

- Install `nvm`\
  Linux, OSX: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm \
  Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
- Install `Node.js` _Recommended For Most Users_ version (12.18.4 for now) using nvm \
  Linux, OSX: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage \
  Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#usage
  ```
  nvm install 12.18.4
  nvm use 12.18.4
  ```
- Install `aws-cli` version 2 \
  Linux: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html \
  Windows: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html \
  OSX: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html
- Install `Serverless framework` globally via npm \
  https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/
  ```
  npm install -g serverless
  ```
- Create AWS user with at least programmatic access. It will be better to use a user with the Admin access. Download
  user's credentials.\
  Set up `AWS credentials` according to `Serverless framework` documentation. \
  Name the profile as it named in the `env.yml -> PROFILE` field. \
  (For `local` and `dev` stages it should be `win`, for `prod` stage - name of the client) \
  https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/config-credentials/
  ```
  serverless config credentials --provider aws --key ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --profile PROFILE
  ```
- Install `git` https://git-scm.com/downloads
- If the repository is private you should set up SSH key or use HTTPS for cloning it
- Clone the repository
- Login to WIN's private npm account `npm login` with account from Notion `Accounts` page
  or https://damiam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ICS/pages/723255313/Working+with+private+NPM+for+iconik-api
- FOR CLIENTS PERFORMING INSTALL - They can add `.npmrc` file with following info:
  ```
  //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=5c2a9f90-081e-459e-9400-46b5228dfe56
  ```
- Install node_modules running the command in the root of the project
  ```
  npm i
  ```

2. Set up environment variables

- Open env.yml file, you can see stage sections here. For example, `local`, `dev`, and `prod`. If you deploy on
  production use `prod` section and do not touch other sections.
- Input your AWS region, for example, `us-east-1`
- Go to AWS Console `Key Management Service` and create Symmetric key in your region
- In the root folder of the project create kms_key.yml file and copy your key (Key ID) here like
  ```
  key: your_key_here
  ```
- You can add any environment variables. If you need to secure them, encrypt them.
- Copy the value of variable and run the command in the root of the project
  ```
  sls env --attribute VARIABLE_NAME --value variable_value --stage your_stage --encrypt
  ```
- `If you use some common variables`, like

  ```yaml
  common: &common
    REGION: us-east-1
    PROFILE: win
    CLIENT: WIN

  local:
    <<: *common
  ```

  The plugin will add this variables to all stages, but we don't want it. So after encrypting, copy encrypted value of
  the new variable, revert changes and paste it to the right place.

- Go to the iconik and create app with name `WIN Automation`. You should choose the admin user for this app. If the
  app already exists, use it.
- Copy app id and run the command in the root of the
  project `sls env --attribute ICONIK_APP_ID --value your_app_id --stage prod --encrypt`. Do not forget to do the
  step `If you use some common variables`.
- Copy auth token and run the command in the root of the
  project `sls env --attribute ICONIK_AUTH_TOKEN --value your_auth_token --stage prod --encrypt`. Do not forget to do
  the step `If you use some common variables`.
- You are ready for deploying

3. Deploy

- Run the command in the root of the project
  ```
  npm run deploy:your_stage
  ```

4. Set up features

- After successful deployment you will see the API URLs. Copy the URLs that ends on `/initialization`, post them to
  the browser URL input and click enter. They will create all needed stuff in your iconik account.

### The project contains:

- The Media Info feature that uses mediainfo binary file and returns media info by url
- Examples of offline plugins and docker-compose file for working with AWS resources offline
- Examples of IAM Role Statements
- Example of different AWS resources
- Examples of models for dynamoose library
- Examples of models for sequelize library
- Examples of services for working with AWS resources
- Simple CircleCI configuration

### Project structure

- .circleci - Configuration for CI/CD
- api - Code of the features or CRUD operations of entities
  - feature_name - Code of one feature or CRUD operations of one entity. It should cover the area of one responsibility.
    For example, Media Info feature, CRUD operations (create, remove, update, delete) for user entity
    - handler.ts - This is a handler file. It should contain Lambda functions for one feature. For example, Media Info
      feature or CRUD operations for the user entity.
    - feature_name.manager.ts - It's the feature manager. Its methods should implement some feature's functionality
    - feature_name.service.ts - It's the feature service. Its methods should implement one of the main steps of some
      feature's functionality
    - feature_name.interface.ts - This file should contain all required interfaces for the feature
- bin - Executable files (third party libraries that can be used inside a Lambda function)
- helper - All auxiliary code
  - app-errors.ts - This file contains the class that derives from Node.js Error class. It should be used for providing
    custom errors with the proper structure
  - error-handler.ts - This file contains the class that helps handle errors
  - helper.ts - This file contains auxiliary functions
  - logger.ts - This file contains log function that helps log data in the proper way
- models - Models for the databases
  - user.model.ts
  - job.model.ts
- serverless - YAML files for description Serverless resources
  - functions - YAML files for description Lambda function with their triggers
    - FeatureName.yml - YAML file for description Lambda functions with their triggers for one feature
  - resources - YAML files for description resources like S3 buckets, SQS, DynamoDB tables, etc.
    - APIGateway.yml
    - Buckets.yml
    - ElasticSearch.yml
    - SQS.yml
    - Tables.yml
- services - Classes for working with third party libraries, APIs, services, etc.
  - cloud-formation.service.ts
  - email.service.ts
  - s3.service.ts
- env.yml - Environment variables
- package.json
- README.md
- serverless.yml - Contains the main description of the service
- webpack.config.json
- sonar-project.properties - Contains the configuration for static code analysis

## Static code analysis

- Start SonarQube docker container with command `npm run sonarqube:up`
- Start tests with command `npm run test`
- Start analysis with command `npm run sonarqube-verify`
- Go to http://localhost:9000
- Log in with _admin/admin_ credentials
- Now you can see the project's report

## How to add evn variable

Read this https://github.com/DieProduktMacher/serverless-env-generator

Add kms_key.yml file with `key` field and your KMS Id to the root.

### In short:

#### Viewing environment variables

Use the following commands to read and decrypt variables from your YAML environment files:

#### List variables

```sh
serverless env
serverless env --stage $STAGE
```

#### View one variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME
serverless env --attribute $NAME --stage $STAGE

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME
sls env -a $NAME -s $STAGE
```

#### Decrypt variables

```sh
serverless env --decrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --decrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --stage $STAGE --decrypt

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME --decrypt
sls env -a $NAME -s $STAGE -d
```

#### Setting environment variables

Use the following commands to store and encrypt variables in your YAML environment files:

Note that variables are stored to the first file listed in _envFiles_.

#### Set a variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --stage $STAGE

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME -v $PLAINTEXT
sls env --a $NAME -v $PLAINTEXT --s $STAGE
```

#### Set and encrypt a variable

```sh
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --encrypt
serverless env --attribute $NAME --value $PLAINTEXT --stage $STAGE --encrypt

#shorthand:
sls env -a $NAME -v $PLAINTEXT -e
sls env -a $NAME -v $PLAINTEXT -s $STAGE -e
```
